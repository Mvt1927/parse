# Laravel Parse

This library pretends to make Parse usable in a more Eloquent-ish manner. For Laravel 5.2+.

## Features:

* Initialize Parse automatically.
* Use facade classes that wraps Parse's classes, exposing an (again) Eloquent-ish interface.
* Enabled to work with Parse's relations (for now supporting "belongs to", "has many" and "has many in array").
* Login using Laravel's authentication framework with Parse users.

## Inspiration from:

* GrahamCampbell's [Laravel-Parse](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Parse/)
* HipsterJazzbo's [LaraParse](https://github.com/HipsterJazzbo/LaraParse)
